# Sort GPX files

This reorders your .GPX routes to make sure your start and end points are actually where you want them to be.

You can automatically detect your location or select a location by moving a marker around.
Then you can open the file you want sorted.
Click download and it will sort the locations linearly to start and end close to your location.

It will not add or remove points along the route, only reorders it without affecting the actual route.
This means you may have to add or remove some points yourself if the route was not a circle.
